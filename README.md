In our corpus, the way in which idyllic descriptions—which evoke images of purity, serenity, and innocence, often associated with Greek nymphs—are reserved exclusively for white characters. Black women, on the other hand, are portrayed as strong and resilient figures, reinforcing a distinct stereotype.

| Women (Black/White) | Excerpt or Character Description | Criteria Y/N |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **White**           | "There lived a woman with candid eyes and a smile as serene as the waters of a lake at dawn." | **Y:** The metaphor of serenity and purity refers to the idealized image of Greek nymphs. “Sincere eyes” and “serene smile” evoke delicacy. |
| **Black**           | "Her hair was as black as the night, her eyes shone like stars and her skin was like the warm sun of Brazil." | **N:** Despite the visual metaphors ("hair as black as night", "eyes as bright as stars"), the reference to the hot Brazilian sun refers to an exotic representation and not to the idyllic fragility of the nymphs. |
| **White**           | "Her hair was silver like the moon on a clear night and her eyes were blue like the ocean on calm days." | **Y:** Elements such as the moon, calm sea and silver hair refer to the softness and tranquility associated with the figure of the nymph, reinforcing the idyllic archetype. |
| **Black**           | "A strong and beautiful woman, with skin as dark as the night and curly hair that looked like a golden crown." | **N:** The emphasis on strength and royalty ("strong and beautiful", "golden crown") moves the character away from the fragility associated with Greek nymphs and inserts her into a narrative of resistance and power, reinforcing a distinct stereotype. |

While white women are described with metaphors of softness, delicacy and calm, black women are often associated with images of strength and resistance, which reflects historically rooted racial constructions.
